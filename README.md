## üåç Installation

```bash
npm i -S spacebro-client
# or
yarn add spacebro-client
```

## üëã Usage

First, you need to start a [spacebro server](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/spacebro).

```bash
$ npm i -g spacebro # or yarn global add spacebro
$ spacebro
```

Then, it's time to write some code:

```js
const spacebroClient = require('spacebro-client')

spacebroClient.connect('127.0.0.1', 8888, {
  clientName: 'foo',
  channelName: 'bar'
})

spacebroClient.on('hello', function () { console.log('world') })
spacebroClient.emit('hello')
```

## üöÄ API

### `spacebroClient.connect([[address, ]port, ]options)`

Look for a server.

```js
// For more details about possible options, see below.
const option = {
  clientName: 'foo',
  channelName: 'bar'
}

// this call does not use any auto-discovery (mdns/avahi/bonjour) feature
// and just perfoms a basic connection request on `ws://${address}:${port}`.
spacebroClient.connect('127.0.0.1', 8888, options)

// use auto-discovery to find if the specified MDNS address (xyz.local)
// broadcasts a 'spacebro' service, retrieve its port, and connect to it.
spacebroClient.connect('specific-computer.local', options)

// simply connects to the first 'spacebro' service that is broadcasted on the network.
// (see the `multiService` option if you want to connect to multiple services)
spacebroClient.connect(options)
```

#### options:

| name | default | required |¬†description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **zeroconfName** | `'spacebro'` | *optional* | Name of the MDNS service that will be looked for if no address and port are given. |
| **clientName** | `null` | *recommended* | Your client name. Can be useful to perform targeted events and for monitoring. |
| **channelName** | `null` | *recommended* | The channel your app will communicate in. This is especially usefull if you have multiple apps using the same server. |
| **packers** | `[]` | *optional* | Array of packers, see hooks below. |
| **unpackers** | `[]` | *optional* | Array of unpackers, see hooks below. |
| **verbose** | `true` | *optional* | Should spacebro-client display logs (connection / emission / reception) ? |
| **sendBack** | `true` | *optional* | Should this client receive its own events ? |
| **multiService** | `false` | *optional* | Should spacebro-client connects to every `zeroconfName` service it finds on the network ? |

### `spacebroClient.emit(eventName[, data])`

Broadcast a specific event to all the clients in channel. `data` must be a JSON object.

### `spacebroClient.sendTo(eventName, target[, data])`

Send an event to a specific target in the channel. `data` must be a JSON object.

### `spacebroClient.on(eventName, handler)`

Listen to a specific event.

### `spacebroClient.once(eventName, handler)`

Listen to a specific event only once.

### `spacebroClient.off(eventName)`

Remove a specific event listener.

## ‚Ü™Ô∏è Hooks

### Packers

Before you send an event to the server, all packers associated with that event and all global packers (with no associated event) are called and applied to that event. They receive a single argument which is an object with two properties, the eventName and the data, and can return a new version of those data. If nothing is returned, the message will remain unchanged.

### Unpackers

Unpackers are call when you receive a message from the server, before any handler is called. You can use to alter data (same as packers) but also to check the message as if an unpacker returns *false*, the message will not be sent to the handlers, it will also break the unpacking chain.

## üñ• Browser

You can use spacebro-client in the browser. You will need few depencies that you can find bellow:

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/1.4.8/socket.io.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/socketio-wildcard@latest"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-signals/1.0.0/js-signals.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this depencies you can include the spacebro-client lib like any script and use the `window.spacebroClient` object.

## Examples

You can find many real life examples in the `example/` folder of this repository.

## Troubleshooting

### üèì ping pong

Do not try to test with `'ping'` and `'pong'` events, those are reserved.

```
- `ping`. Fired when a ping packet is written out to the server.
- `pong`. Fired when a pong is received from the server.
```
